# ⚙️ Flutter Settings Screen (Dark & Light Mode)

A beautiful, modern **Settings screen** built with **Flutter**, inspired by a curated design spotted on X (via [@leyeconnect](https://twitter.com/leyeconnect)).  

This implementation comes with:
-  Dark & Light mode support  
-  Clean, color-coded tiles  
-  A distinct **Danger Zone** section  
-  A clickable **Learn more about us** link (text only, not the icon)  
-  Simple theme switching (System / Light / Dark)

## Features

- **Theme Controller**: lightweight, package-free way to toggle between `ThemeMode.system`, `ThemeMode.light`, and `ThemeMode.dark`.  
- **Danger Zone**: Always-yellow warning icon with clear separation.  
- **Learn More Section**: Icon stays static; only the text row is clickable (faithful to the original design).  
- **Bottom Navigation Bar**: Matches the mockup design, with `Settings` tab selected.  
- **Production-ready code**: Clean architecture, reusable `SettingTile` widget.
